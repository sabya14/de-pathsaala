# The story continues
With initial success of his Library, With determination in his heart, Mr. Smith embarked on a journey to create the ultimate book Library.
He started by writing enchanting stories, in the form of test cases, that would act as guiding stars for his code.
His first tale was about adding a Fiction Book to the Library.
He crafted a magical test case that summoned a new Fiction Book to join the Library.
As the test ran successfully, he was thrilled to see the first signs of life in his Library.

Continuing on, Mr. Smith penned another enchanting tale, this time about a Non-Fiction Book seeking a place in the Library.
He added the test case, and with just a few more incantations in Python, he brought the Non-Fiction Book to life as well.



Can you try to evolve our existing code to match Mr Smith's dream in a TDD way?
