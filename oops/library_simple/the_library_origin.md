# Story Time
Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a wise old librarian named Mr. Smith.
He wanted to create a digital Library to manage the town's book collection more efficiently.
Being a strong believer in the power of OOP, he decided to use Python to implement his Library.


Mr. Smith wanted to start by defining the blueprint for a book in his Library. He created a Book class with attributes like title, author, genre, and publication year.
Next, he wanted to create the Library class responsible for managing the collection of books.
The Library class would handle adding new books, searching for books, and displaying all the books in the collection.

Let's see how Mr. Smith achieved this..
